CEMENTO is a component python package of the larger **SDLE FAIR application suite** of tools for creating scientific ontologies more efficiently. This package provides functional interfaces for converting draw.io diagrams of ontologies into RDF triples in the turtle (``.ttl``) format and vice versa. This package is able to provide term matching between reference ontology files and terms used in draw.io diagrams allowing for faster ontology deployment while maintaining robust cross-references.

CEMENTO stands for the Centralized Entity Mapping & Extraction Nexus for Triples and Ontologies -- a mouthful for an acronym, but an important metaphor for the package building the road to ontologies for materials data.
